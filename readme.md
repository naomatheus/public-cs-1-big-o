# Big O Notation

## Overview
This lesson covered the basics of Big O notation and analyzing algorithmic complexity.

There were two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Big O Notation](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/511)
2. In-Class Exercise: [Analyzing Algorithms](exercises/BigOExercise.md)

## Learning Outcomes
- Explain how Big O notation is used to describe algorithms.
- Define constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and factorial Big O runtimes.
- Analyze algorithms to determine their Big O runtime.


## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class
* 5-6 hours outside of class reading up on additional concerns

## Additional Resources
- [The Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) is the authority on Big O complexities.
